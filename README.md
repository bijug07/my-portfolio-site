# 💼 Biju George - Portfolio Website

Welcome to my personal portfolio site, built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I’m building strong front-end development skills with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, along with MS Access for data-driven applications. I enjoy crafting clean, responsive websites and improving user experience through DOM manipulation and UI/UX design principles.
